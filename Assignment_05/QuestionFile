Question1: Design an algorithm and  implement it using a program to find which alphabet has maximum number of occurrences and print it. 
Question2: . Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether two elements exist
             such that their sum is equal to the given key element. 
Question3: You have been given two sorted integer arrays of size m and n. Design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find 
            list of elements which are common to both.
